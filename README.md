# 📊 India's Population Visualization (1960–2022)

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **SkillCraft Technology**. The objective was to visualize the distribution of a **continuous variable** using real-world data.

## 🧠 Task Description
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.  
> I chose to analyze **India's population growth from 1960 to 2022** using World Bank data.
